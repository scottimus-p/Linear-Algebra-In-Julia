# Linear algebra routines written in Julia

This code implements some linear algebra routines using Julia. It was written as part of my coursework in CS 383C - Advanced Linear Algebra for Computation from The University of Texas at Austin.  

The motivation for writing this code was purely educational and in no way practical; I wanted to solidify what I was learning in the course and was looking for an excuse to learn Julia. Julia already has built-in packages that perform all of these routines so you're better off using those because they probably (correction: definitely) have fewer mistakes and run faster.

The textbook for the course, along with video lectures, are freely available online at:

Thank you Robert van de Geijn and Maggie Myers for making this material available for everyone.
